Hello and welcome! 

Quick start: 

- To play the demo, open "Demo Videos" and play the mov file.

- To play the game, open 
"SpaceBattles/SpaceBattles.pyde" in processing and run it. 
Click on the screen and try shoot the main head, avoiding his
mini-heads! (Or hands, respective to the puppet).
(Please note you will need to have the sound library added to 
your Processing version.)
*Note: If you close the sketch and re-open it without closing 
processing the sound will not play. This is a processing bug and
does not affect you playing the sketch the first time. 

File explenation:

MotionCapture.py - This is the main Motion Capture script. 
All the good stuff happens here and a final motion array is saved
to SpaceBattles/positions.txt after execution is completed. 

ArrayConditioning.py - This is an eccess file, if you would like to convert
a numpy array or such. Not required for anything.

SpaceBattles folder - this just contains all the requred files to run
the game in processing.
